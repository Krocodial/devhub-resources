# DevHub Resources

A set of resources to be included in the BC Gov DevHub.  The resources here don't hava natural home elsewhere, so we can house them here.  It is an explicity decision to keep these resources distinct from the code of the DevHub.

Files within the `resources` folder structure are referenced explicitly or implicitly in the DevHub registry, processed by the DevHub automated build process, and presented in the [live DevHub app](https://developer.gov.bc.ca).
