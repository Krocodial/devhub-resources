# Supported Tools

In order to help facilitate agile development on the platform, the Platform team provides several tools and services (in addition to the platform itself), which are widely available for any team to use.

Some of these tools exist to promote and encourage interaction, cooperation and cohesion among the various teams working on the platform. 
These tools are, in general, intended to be used by many (or all) of our teams in order to encourage broad cooperation across the whole community.
Examples include Rocketchat, Documize and Github.

The remaining tools generally fall under another broad category which involve providing technical resources to teams in situations where those resources would provide significant time-savings to many teams across the community.
Examples include Keycloak, Artifactory, and the Openshift Platform itself.

You can find a topic here on the Devhub that details all of the tools available to our development teams [here](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/self-service-tools).
