## Chat Channel Conventions
Below are the chat channels we manage and the intended use/etiquette around each.

We are encouraging a community/peer-to-peer support model where community members are expected to participate by sharing their experience and advice, and responding to problems and questions as they are able.  
While the platform team will attempt to triage, and moderate discussions, the success and sustainability of the model depends to a large degree on participation from the broader community.

For more information about the the expectations involved with the community support model, please see (insert link to Onboarding Outcomes here)

Note: Our current chat space is on Rocket.Chat at https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/

## Channels

# \#devops-sos
\#devops-sos is where you should post when you have one of the issues below:

 * a production problem with an OpenShift-hosted app that you can't solve without external assistance from the DevOps platform team or AdvSol.
 * an issue with an OpenShift hosted project support tool that has caused a work stoppage that cannot be worked around

Note that normal BC Gov support channels (77000, IMB help desks, etc.) should be used for shared infrastructure such as reverse proxies, SiteMinder, firewall rules, etc.

This channel will be monitored by the platform team and AdvSol during business hours.
