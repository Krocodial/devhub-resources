## Chat Channel Conventions
Below are the chat channels we manage and the intended use/etiquette around each.

As much as possible, we are encouraging a community/peer-to-peer support model where community members are expected to participate by sharing their experience and advice, and responding to problems and questions as they are able.  While the platform team will attempt to triage, and moderate discussions, the success and sustainability of the model depends to a large degree on participation from the broder community.


Note: Our current chat space is on Rocket.Chat at https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/

## Channels

# \#devops-sos
\#devops-sos is where you should post when you have one of the issues below:

 * a production problem with an OpenShift-hosted app that you can't solve without external assistance from the DevOps platform team or AdvSol.
 * an issue with an OpenShift hosted project support tool that has caused a work stoppage that cannot be worked around

Note that normal BC Gov support channels (77000, IMB help desks, etc.) should be used for shared infrastructure such as reverse proxies, SiteMinder, firewall rules, etc.

This channel will be monitored by the platform team and AdvSol during business hours.     


# \#devops-how-to

\#devops-how-to is for asking *non-urgent* questions about approaches to solving problems, evaluating technical options, getting feedback on different approaches, familiarity with platform features or tools, resources/examples, etc. 

# \#devops-alerts

\#devops-alerts is where the operations team will provide notices and progress notifications of upcoming or ongoing maintenance activities or incidents.  


# \#devops-operations

\#devops-operations is primarily for communications between the OCIO DevOps Team Services team, DXC Operations Team, and Red Hat.  On occasion, conversation with community members may get pulled into this channel (e.g. from #devops-sos) for troubleshooting, etc. but in general community members should not frequently need to post in #devops-operations.

# \#devops-requests (deprecated)

\#devops-requests is no longer used. Visit [request repo](https://github.com/bcgov/devops-request-records) for the following:
 
 * provisioning of new OpenShift projects
 * granting new users access to the OpenShift platform
 * removal of access for users who no longer require it
 * SSO realm creation
 * Quota increases
 
 Details and templates for each of the above request are provided elsewhere in the DevHub. 
 
# \#general

Anything that might be of interest to the community.

# \#geows-how-to
