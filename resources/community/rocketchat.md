## It's Community

Since its inception, Rocket.Chat has been growing its user base. Since January 2020 our userbase is now over 1200! 

Most chat channels are public and allow you to discover/learn about new tech, upcoming events, solutions to common problems and even more. 

For teams that work in OpenShift, it is also their primary tool to provision things like Teams in Github, projects in OpenShift, and SSO Realms.

See [here](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Community-and-Events/Chat-Channel-Conventions) for more information on the community usage.


## It's A Place To Ask Questions

Over 850 users means there is a plethora of knowledge that is open for sharing. Solutions to common tech woes, 
introductions to new tech, provoking reads in a shared article, discovery of events such as Openshift 101 and Exchange Lab Tours and more. 
You don't need to be a Rocket.Chat veteran to contribute either :)

> Case Study: The Devhub UX Survey
The Devhub (https://developer.gov.bc.ca) Team created a survey to learn more about how users are interacting with the app.
This was passed communicated through Rocket.Chat in the `#general` channel. Several community members responded to our survey which
has helped not get insight into usage of the Devhub, but has provided useful data to influence future work.
