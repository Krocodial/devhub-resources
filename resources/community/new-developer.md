## A Guide to Developing for Gov

There are a plethora of things to consider when developing apps for Gov. 

_Where Do I find assets and common stylesheets for things like a header?_

_What is Openshift and how do I use it?_

_What resources are available to me as a developer to troubleshoot, learn, and contribute back to the community?_

_What are some best practices when working on a project?_


The following documents are aimed to highlight several of these questions and provide helpful information when developing apps for Gov. In fact many of these documents were created for the learnings provided by developing _developer.gov.bc.ca_. In other words, this guide is aimed to provide you with information that is not only relevant but has been tested.
